					Taking place in the land of dawn, the 4 kingdoms live peacefully without any war. The people that live in this land don't know anything of weapons, martial arts, or even violence. But, one day, many people suddenly woke up with great power, this power is called Xtream, with each person's power is different from one another. Some uses this power for better good, but some uses it for destruction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ifrit, the fire kingdom, one of the most peaceful kingdom, started to change. Lead by Au, the fire king with the power to control monsters, they start to conquer other kingdom's territories using their great power, and many have fallen to demise because of them. 
				</p>

					However, the other 3 kingdoms won't fall so easily. 
					<ul>
						<li>Zenyatta, the monk prince of earth</li>
						<li>Genji Shimada, the ninja prince of wind</li>
						<li>Hanzo Shimada, the warrior prince of water</li>
					</ul>
					Together, they build an union, called the Xtream chaser, ready to chase away the invasion of the fire kingdom. It is up to the young prince of the 3 kingdoms, to work together, find more allies, level up, prepare their stronghold and weapon, in order to face the powerful fire kingdom. And so, another tale full of fighting and action begins in this sacred land.
